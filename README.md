# Dungeon Maze
Game created using Phaser, JavaScript, and jQuery. Was inspired by Zelda. Made a Dungeon Maze map, where you go and find different items. I found sprites then started building the map. Struggled a little with the animations and displaying the map. Made my map a little too big. Added flames that kill you for a little more excitement. In the future I would like to add some enemies and attacks.
